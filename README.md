# Fresh Chat RTC

A `fresh` chat app that leverages both Server-Sent-Events, and    
deploys `BroadcastChannel` to create a WebRTC signal server.    
This signal server api is then used to connect two peers over a WebRTC-Datachannel.

The advantage of using this communication strategy is that after the    
dataChannel has been negociated, the Signal service is no longer required   
allowing the deploy isolates to terminate gracefully.
